# Security Protocol Python Implementation

This document provides instructions for using the Python script that implements our security protocol.

## Script Location

The Python implementation of the security protocol can be found in the file `security_protocol.py` in this repository.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the script and the security tools it uses.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script with root privileges:
   ```
   sudo python3 security_protocol.py
   ```

Note: This script assumes you're running on a Linux system. You may need to modify interface names (e.g., `eth0`) and IP ranges in the script to match your network configuration.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following actions:
1. Runs Suricata for intrusion detection
2. Executes Zeek for network analysis
3. Performs an Nmap scan for vulnerability assessment
4. Checks file integrity with Tripwire
5. Runs rkhunter for rootkit detection
6. Performs a ClamAV scan for malware detection
7. Captures network traffic with tshark

The script also includes logging functionality, writing its activities to a file named `security_protocol.log`.

Remember, this is a basic implementation. In a real-world scenario, you would need to:
- Configure each tool properly
- Set up proper logging and alerting
- Implement more robust error handling
- Schedule regular runs of this script (e.g., via cron jobs or a task scheduler)
- Regularly review and update the tools and configurations

Always test scripts in a safe, controlled environment before running them on production systems.
