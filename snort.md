# Snort

## Description
Snort is an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS).

## How it's used in security matters
Snort monitors network traffic in real-time, analyzing packets and comparing them against a set of rules to detect potential security threats, such as malware infections, hacking attempts, and policy violations.

## Command syntax
The basic syntax for running Snort is:

```
snort [options] -c <config-file>
```

## Example
To run Snort in IDS mode with a specific configuration file:

```
snort -q -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

This command runs Snort quietly (-q), outputs alerts to the console (-A console), and uses the specified configuration file.
