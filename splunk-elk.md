# Splunk (ELK Stack)

## Description
While Splunk is proprietary, the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is an open-source alternative for log analysis and visualization.

## How it's used in security matters
The ELK Stack is used for collecting, processing, storing, and visualizing log data from various sources. This helps in identifying security incidents, troubleshooting issues, and gaining insights into system and application behavior.

## Command syntax
The ELK Stack consists of multiple components. Here's a basic command to start Elasticsearch:

```
elasticsearch
```

## Example
To start Elasticsearch and specify a custom configuration file:

```
elasticsearch -Epath.conf=/path/to/custom/config
```

Note: Logstash and Kibana have their own separate commands and configurations.
