# iptables

## Description
iptables is a command-line firewall utility for Linux operating systems.

## How it's used in security matters
iptables is used to configure the Linux kernel firewall, allowing or blocking network traffic based on defined rules. It's crucial for protecting systems from unauthorized access and network-based attacks.

## Command syntax
The basic syntax for iptables is:

```
iptables [options] [chain] [rule-specification] [target]
```

## Example
To add a rule that allows incoming SSH connections:

```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

This command appends (-A) a rule to the INPUT chain, allowing incoming TCP packets on port 22 (SSH).
